# Mini FPGA Project made for PYNQ-Z2

This is a collection of FPGA projects that I implemented in order to aquire basic FPGA skills like: 
- Writing **RTL** modules with **System Verilog**, **Verilog**, and **VHDL**;
- Writing **Testbenchs** with **System Verilog**, and **CocoTB**;
- Getting familiar with **TCL commands** for **constraints file**, adding **delays**, and **scripting**;
- Getting familiar of using **version control** with FPGA projects;
- Getting a better understanding of **Timing Analysis**.
